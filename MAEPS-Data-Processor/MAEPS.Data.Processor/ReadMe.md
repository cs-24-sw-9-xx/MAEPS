# Data Processor
This tool is used to analyze the data generated by MAEPS.

It has two input arguments: 
- "--path" which provides the path to the data folder containing the experiments.
- "--groupBy" which determines what parameter the experiment should be grouped by (i.e. what we are experimenting with)

It generates signal(scatter) plots for each scenario with the worst- and average idleness.
An aggregated graph and csv is also generated across results from the different algorithms.

Lastly a summary file is also generated for each of the experiments.

It is currently very slow. So expect it to take a while to process the data, especially if its large files.
